# vue-test-utils

When test `Vue.js` project, you probably need some kind of thing to check the
DOM, or trigger events to check if the component work correctly. Of course, jQuery
is your friend, but it add so many feature that you do not need.

This utils currently only provided three functions to help you test your program.

## 1. $ function

Just like the `$` funciton in jQuery, except that it is bound to the `Rel` element.
Then you can do this:

    const vm = new Vue(...);
		vm.$('some-element');

## 2. $$ function

The `$` function is just a proxy to `querySelector`, but this function is proxied
to `querySelectorAll`, so it returns a `NodeList`.

## 3. $fire function

This combines the `$` function with a simple event trigger which is brought from
the elegant, small but power full JS library: blissfuljs. Then you can:

    const vm = new Vue(...);
		vm.$fire('some-element', 'click');
		// or with event options
		vm $fire('some-element', 'click', { ctrlKey: true });

Although they are just simple proxy functions that are easy to create, they extremely
improved your productivity, trust me ^_^.
